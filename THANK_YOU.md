# Acknowledgements & Thank You

The creation of KV Player would not have been possible without the incredible work of the teams and communities behind these open-source projects. A special thank you goes out to:

*   **Python:** For providing the powerful and versatile programming language that forms the foundation of this application.

*   **The Kivy Project:** For creating a brilliant cross-platform GUI framework that allows a single Python codebase to run beautifully on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

*   **The FFmpeg Team & FFpyplayer:** For developing the world's leading multimedia framework and the Kivy-compatible wrapper that powers all video and audio playback in this player. Your work makes high-performance media handling possible.

*   **The Plyer Project:** For providing a simple and effective way to access native platform features like the file dialog.

*   **The PyInstaller Team:** For creating the essential tool that packages this complex application into a simple, distributable executable for everyone to use.

*   **Font Awesome:** For providing the clean, modern, and comprehensive icon set used throughout the user interface.

This project stands on the shoulders of giants. Thank you to all the developers, contributors, and maintainers who dedicate their time to building the open-source tools we all rely on.
