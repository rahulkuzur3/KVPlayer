# Welcome to KV Player!

Thank you for checking out this project.

The goal of KV Player was to create a simple, modern, and high-performance media player that works everywhere. It's built with Python and Kivy, and it's completely open-source.

Whether you're here to use the player, look at the code, or contribute, I'm glad you stopped by.

For instructions on how to run the player from source or build your own executable, please see the main **[README.md](README.md)** file.

Hope you enjoy it!
